studentguide.com

Objective of site:

-In a technologically improving environment, it would be absurd to not build a go-to website that caters for new students and acts as a gps and a map and 
a get-to-know-the-place-guide.
-This website focuses on aiding freshmen, say for instance:
	-John is a new student at EUL and John so happens to be in need of a house he can rent within the school precinct. Now with the absent of studentguide.com
	John is forced circumstantially to knock on each door and ask for possible houses. Now studentguide.com is meant to ease this difficulty for John by just a 
	notifying him whenever a vacant house /apartment of his liking avails.
	-John could link up with other students and see what functions or parties are scheduled for the night, day, week, month and year. 
	-John is notified of buzzing spots and cool touristic sites!!
-Those who are in real estate can now utilise easier ways to tenant their properties and forereach contractual agreements prior.
-Restaurant owners can now advertise their spots too and get customer traffic.
